# five-picture-and-caption-showcase
This is the five picture showcase for any landing page of a website. 

There are 5 modules named module11, module22, module33, module44, and module55. 

As you can see from the snap-shot attached that two images are bigger on first row and on the second row, there are three smaller ones.

The modules for first row are module11 and module22. The modules for second row are module33, module44, and module55.

The modules are pure CSS based code. The caption strip at the bottom of each image is done by adding padding and color to H2 tag of the any module class.
